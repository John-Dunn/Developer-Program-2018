### Description of Design Decisions
Aside from the circuit breaker, the two other main patterns applied are *fail early and fail loud* and *pull over push payments*. All public functions check several conditions in the beginning such as the trade state or access control and revert if they are not met. Since transferring token and calling a contract function in the same transaction is not user very friendly (probably not doable without writing a contract), the decision was made to use pull payments over push payments. In addition, this also ensures that no external calls are made to unknown accounts which could potentially then run malicious code. The only external calls made are to token contracts (those however pose a risk).
Special consideration was made to prevent [this](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YLPtQxZu1UAvO9cZ1O2RPXBbT0mooh4DYKjA_jp-RLM/edit) frontrunning attack. The [mutex pattern](https://consensys.github.io/smart-contract-best-practices/known_attacks/#dos-with-block-gas-limit) was used to prevent reentrancy.
